## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fixed some bug that prevents our plugin from sending actions to <map-view> in case [viewer-domain](https://developers.situm.com/sdk_documentation/cordova/jsdoc/latest/mapview) parameter wasn't specified.

- Fixed some bug that prevents our plugin to use [global mode](https://situm.com/docs/mobile-sdks-positioning/#sdk-building-vs-global-mode) when positioning with an empty buildingIdentifier on Android.
